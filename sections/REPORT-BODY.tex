\section{Weighted Least Squares (WLS) linear fits}

In this section we present plots showing the weighted least squares (WLS) least squares linear fit line to the RT trace plots. The weighting method used is $w = 1/\epsilon^2$ where $w$ represents the weight applied to an error bar, and $\epsilon$ represents the magnitude of the error.
