\subsection{Velocity map binning methods}
\label{sec:binning-methods}
The MaNGA DAP utilises various spaxel binning models to process the IFU fibre bundle data, via the DRP, into the output cubes and maps. The available binning schemes used to produce kinematic gas and stellar velocity maps, together with a brief description of each are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item SPX - single spaxel measurements i.e. no binning.
    \item VOR10 - Voronoi binning, an adaptive spatial binning method where low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio spaxels are grouped to achieve an overall S/N of 10  \citep{2003MNRAS.342..345C, 2019arXiv190100856W}.
    \item HYB10 - Hybrid binning: Voronoi S/N 10 binning for stellar velocity maps, but unbinned for emission line properties which are used to generate gas velocity maps.
\end{itemize}  

In this study we have utilised MaNGA datacubes released in DR15 MPL-7 which have been processed in the DAP using the hybrid HYB10 binning model, i.e. using VOR10 binning for the stellar velocity maps. However, the MaNGA project team currently have an internal dataset available, MPL-8. Data cubes in MPL-8 include VOR10 and SPX binning schema. We were interested to make a comparison of the Radon trace profiles generated from the maps processed using the Voronoi and SPX binning schemes. A limited sample of MPL-8 cubes were made available for this comparison exercise. We selected 2 galaxies from our PSB sample with stellar velocity maps having good spatial definition, and another 2 with poor resolution in order to compare the Radon transform profiles using the Voronoi binning and SPX (unbinned) methods. The selected data cubes were firstly, examples of good resolution/definition in stellar velocity maps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 7977-12704
    \item 8322-1901
\end{itemize}

and secondly, examples of poor resolution/definition in stellar velocity maps, i.e. having a blotchy appearance, due to spatial binning of low S/N spaxels, or with masked spaxels:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 8993-6104
    \item 9088-12703
\end{itemize}

Stellar velocity maps together with their Radon transform and trace profiles for the well defined example 7977-12704 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:binning-comparison}. The differences being the binning models of the input stellar velocity maps: Voronoi binning in the left-hand panel and SPX binning on the right. A comparison shows that there is little difference in the Radon transform and Radon profile plots. It is also apparent that the Radon transform algorithm for the SPX velocity maps yields a greater number of valid data points in the trace plot. We conclude that both VOR10 and SPX binned maps would lead to the same Type classification in these cases. This conclusion was also obtained for the other selected galaxy showing good resolution in the stellar velocity map, 8322-1901 (figure not included). 

However, the same conclusion does not apply in the case of the low resolution stellar velocity map examples, 8993-6104 shown in Figure \ref{fig:binning-comparison2} and 9088-12703 (figure not included). In these cases, at first sight, there are marked differences in the extent of spatial coverage and shapes of the velocity field PA, the Radon transform minimum and the Radon profile. As shown the control galaxy 8993-6104 displays a clearly asymmetric Radon profile with VOR10 binning, but could possibly be interpreted as an outer bend in the Radon profile trace of the SPX map. However, on closer inspection, looking at the coordinate range of the trace plots, the bend feature at Radon transform coordinates [$\rho$, $\theta$]=[-6,+2],[20, 50] is apparent in both binning model plots. The asymmetric feature at $\rho$ \textgreater\ +2 apparent in the left-hand Voronoi binned trace is not displayed in the SPX output shown in the right-hand panel. Although these differences can be expected due to the exclusion of low S/N low spaxels in the SPX maps, crucially this can easily lead to contradicting visual classifications between the transforms of Voronoi binned and SPX velocity field maps.
