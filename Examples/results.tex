\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

I have calculated a flux of 2.567 \fluxdensity.

The Sombrero galaxy lies at a distance of 10 \Mpc. It has a luminosity of about $10^{11}$ \Lsun, therefore having a mass of around $10^{11}$ \Msun.

Many other interesting results were obtained as reported in Table \ref{tab:resultstable}.

An additional finding was that the speed of light was determined to be approximately $c=3.10^8$ \ms.
