\section{Methods I: Kinematic Position Angle analysis}
\label{sec:kinematics}

\citet{2015A&A...582A..21B} employed the Calor Alto CALIFA survey to study a sample of 103 interacting galaxies at various merger stages: close companions, systems with evidence of morphological interaction and coalesced merger remnants. Classification of the systems is performed by measuring the difference in kinematic position angles of the stellar and ionised gas velocity fields. A sample of 80 non-interacting galaxies was used as a control sample. The findings reveals that 42\% of interacting galaxies have a misalignment of over 16\textdegree\ while this is evident in only 10\% of the control sample.
