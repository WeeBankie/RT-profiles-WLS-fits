\subsection{Mergers guidance}

%%TC:ignore
[JP guidance from VW: remove this when done].
[Ignored in the word count]
Just so I don't forget: in your final report you will also need to include a section on how mergers and post-mergers are detected using morphology alone, perhaps 0.5-1 pages? A good place to start would be my former student Milena's papers: \citet{2016MNRAS.456.3032P} 
\citet{2018MNRAS.477.1708P} 
\citet{2019NatAs...3..440P} 
and this recent one from a MaNGA team member: \citet{2019ApJ...872...76N} 
As before, go up and down the ADS citations and references to ensure you have a complete literature review. 
I will leave this for you to do in your own time, once you have finished I'm happy to look over it.
